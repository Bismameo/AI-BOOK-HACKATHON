RESPONSE_TEXT: "I understand you would like to generate a detailed book cover image. However, as I've mentioned before, I am a text-based AI and do not have the capability to directly generate images or visual content. My functionalities are limited to text processing, file system operations, and code manipulation.\n\nCould you please clarify how you would like me to assist with this book cover? For example, would you like me to:\n*   Find an existing image online that matches your description for you to use?\n*   Generate a detailed textual description of the book cover for a human artist or another image generation tool to use?\n*   Do something else entirely to integrate this concept into your book's existing content (e.g., as a placeholder image or a descriptive paragraph within a chapter)?"
OUTCOME: User attempted to generate an image for a book cover, which is an unsupported capability. Informed user again and requested clarification.
EVALUATION: Correctly identified unsupported request and provided options for alternative approaches.
