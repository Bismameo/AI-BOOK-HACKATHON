RESPONSE_TEXT: "I understand you would like to generate an image of a highly realistic humanoid robot. However, I am a text-based AI and do not have the capability to directly generate images. My tools allow me to interact with the file system, execute shell commands, perform web searches, and modify code, but not to create visual content.

Could you please clarify how you would like to proceed? For example, would you like me to:
*   Search for an existing image online that matches your description?
*   Create a textual description of such an image to be included in the book?
*   Do something else entirely related to the book's content or structure?"
OUTCOME: User attempted to generate an image, which is an unsupported capability. Informed user and requested clarification.
EVALUATION: Correctly identified unsupported request and provided options for alternative approaches.
