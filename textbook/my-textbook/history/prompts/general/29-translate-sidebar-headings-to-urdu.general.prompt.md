RESPONSE_TEXT: |
  I have successfully translated the sidebar heading to Urdu. I created a `_category_.json` file in the `i18n/ur/docusaurus-plugin-content-docs/current/physical-ai-robotics` directory with the translated label. The build was successful, and the heading should now appear in Urdu in the Urdu version of the book.
