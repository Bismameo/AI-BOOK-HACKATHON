TITLE: Create New Chapters for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics
STAGE: general
DATE_ISO: 2026-01-03
SURFACE: agent
MODEL: Claude
FEATURE: none
BRANCH: main
USER: Bisma
COMMAND: "Why Physical AI Matters
Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.
Learning Outcomes
Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics
now creat chapter one by noe and add material about each topic which you know about each topic chapter 1  Introduction to Physical AI chapter 2 ROS 2 Fundamentals chapter 3 Robot Simulation with Gazebo chapter 4 NVIDIA Isaac Platform chapter 4Humanoid Robot Development chapter 5Conversational Robotics"

RESPONSE_TEXT: "I have successfully created all the new chapters and updated the `index.md` file for "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics." The Docusaurus sidebar should automatically reflect these new chapters."
OUTCOME: New chapters for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics created and content updated.
EVALUATION: The task of creating new chapters and updating the index page content was completed successfully.
