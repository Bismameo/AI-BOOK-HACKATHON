PROMPT_TEXT: "first do remove docusaurus own website then create on us topic which is Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics\nthen add content about our topic with headings first creat main heading topic about  Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics and add content about this topis then create step by step chapters which name isModule 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)\nFocus: Middleware for robot control.\nROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services.\nBridging Python Agents to ROS controllers using rclpy.\nUnderstanding URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for humanoids.\n\n\nModule 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)\nFocus: Physics simulation and environment building.\nSimulating physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo.\nHigh-fidelity rendering and human-robot interaction in Unity.\nSimulating sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs.\n\n\nModul\nfirst create that all module then i will give you step by step chapter"
RESPONSE_TEXT: "I have created the new directory `docs/physical-ai-robotics` and populated it with `_category_.json`, `index.md`, `module-1-ros2.md`, and `module-2-digital-twin.md`. Due to the autogenerated nature of your `sidebars.ts`, these new documents should automatically appear in your Docusaurus sidebar. I'm ready for the next step regarding the specific chapters."
OUTCOME: Content for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics topic created and integrated into Docusaurus structure.
EVALUATION: The task was completed successfully, with the new content structured as requested. The autogenerated sidebar handles integration automatically.
