  I have successfully created the `glossary.md` file with initial terms relevant to Chapter 1, and integrated it into the Docusaurus sidebar by modifying `sidebars.ts` to use a manual structure for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" category. This ensures the glossary is easily discoverable and contributes to the book's professional presentation.
