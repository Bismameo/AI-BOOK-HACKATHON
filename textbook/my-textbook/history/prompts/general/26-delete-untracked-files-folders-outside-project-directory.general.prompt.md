  okay which is not important for us project then remove this type of folders and files
RESPONSE_TEXT: |
  Upon receiving explicit permission from the user to operate outside the current project directory, I have successfully deleted the following directories:
  *   `C:\Users\mohsin\AI-BOOK-HACKATHON\history\prompts\textbook-on-physical-ai\`
  *   `C:\Users\mohsin\AI-BOOK-HACKATHON\scripts\__pycache__\`
  These directories were identified as untracked files/folders not critical to the current project.
