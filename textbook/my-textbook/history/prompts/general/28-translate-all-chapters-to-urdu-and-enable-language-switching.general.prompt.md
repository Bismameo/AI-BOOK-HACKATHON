RESPONSE_TEXT: |
  I have successfully translated all the chapters into Urdu and configured the Docusaurus project to support the Urdu locale. The translated content has been placed in the appropriate directory structure, and the language switching button has been enabled.

  The build was successful. You can now run `npm run serve` to see the results locally. You should see a language switcher button that allows you to switch between English and Urdu versions of the book.
