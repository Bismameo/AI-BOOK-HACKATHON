I have stopped the servers. Please follow these instructions carefully:

**1. IMPORTANT SECURITY REMINDER:** Please ensure you have invalidated the old database connection string and are using a new one.

**2. Create and populate the `.env` file:**

*   Navigate to the `server` directory.
*   Create a new file named `.env`.
*   Open the `.env` file and add the following line, replacing `"your_new_neon_db_connection_string"` with your new Neon DB connection string:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL="your_new_neon_db_connection_string"
    ```

**3. Tell me when you have created the `.env` file.**

Once you have created the `.env` file, I will restart the servers and we can test the chatbot again.
