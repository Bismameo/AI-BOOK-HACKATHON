## Why Physical AI Matters
Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they share our physical form and can be trained with abundant data from interacting in human environments. This represents a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to embodied intelligence that operates in physical space.

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand Physical AI principles and embodied intelligence
- Master ROS 2 (Robot Operating System) for robotic control
- Simulate robots with Gazebo and Unity
- Develop with NVIDIA Isaac AI robot platform
- Design humanoid robots for natural interactions
- Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics

## Book Reader Robots
Book reader robots are advanced humanoid or robotic systems designed to interact with physical books, capable of turning pages, scanning content, and even audibly reading text. These robots leverage sophisticated computer vision for navigation and text recognition, robotic manipulation for delicate page turning, and natural language processing (NLP) for understanding and vocalizing the content. Their development represents a fascinating intersection of physical AI, robotics, and assistive technology, with applications ranging from aiding visually impaired individuals to preserving ancient texts.
