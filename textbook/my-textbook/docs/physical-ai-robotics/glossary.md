# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the PHYSICAL AI & HUMANOID ROBOTICS.

## A
**Actuator:** A component of a machine that is responsible for moving and controlling a mechanism or system. It takes energy, usually supplied by electric current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure, and converts it into some kind of motion.

**AI (Artificial Intelligence):** The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding.

## E
**Embodied Intelligence:** The concept that an intelligent agent's cognitive capabilities are deeply connected to its physical body and its sensory-motor experiences, rather than existing purely as abstract computation.

## P
**Physical AI:** A field of artificial intelligence that focuses on intelligent systems embedded in physical bodies, allowing them to perceive, reason, and act within the real world. It integrates AI with robotics, control systems, and sensor technologies.

## S
**Sensor:** A device, module, machine, or subsystem whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and send the information to other electronics, frequently a computer processor.
